# Overview and Mission 

There exists a wide range of applications for machine learning techniques in finance that have been underutilized and underexposed at Duke. FML is a multi-stage internal DAML project that seeks to explore these various applications and create the infrastructure necessary to sustain a permanent student-led algorithmic trading / investment presence at Duke. We are looking for talented, committed, and entrepreneurial students to join us in this venture. 
Project Functions and Intended Outcomes 

Portfolio Analytics (DS): Given the expected returns and volatility of N securities, the theory of optimizing the portfolio for any desired expectation of return or volatility is well understood with Markowitz’s modern portfolio theory. However, the model assumes that the underlying distribution of each security is known which is simply not the case in reality. Instead, statistical machine learning methods can be applied to historical timeseries data to approximate the underlying distribution of the expected return and the volatility. The portfolio analytics team will seek to apply a variety of timeseries machine learning models to predict the future returns and volatility of selected securities, including but not limited to ARIMA, GARCH, and Neural Networks. The tools used will include statsmodels, scikit-learn, and pandas, as well as any others which may come up. 

Portfolio Implementation (SWE): The efficient implementation of a portfolio includes the automated gathering of financial data, the actual implementation of the algorithm that generates the portfolio, as well as ensuring that the code used for the previous tasks and efficient enough to be scaled. In addition, the development of good models will also be challenging for many other reasons, including a very low signal-to-noise ratio, potential redundancy, strong feature correlation, and difficulty of coming up with a proper mathematical formulation. The portfolio implementation team would be working very closely with the portfolio analytics team to come up with efficient and scalable algorithms, as well as to implement a suitable GUI for our proprietary portfolio model. 

Derivative Pricing & Market Making (Research): Given the volatility of an underlying security as well as its underlying distribution the fair market value of derivatives such as call and put options are well-understood using the Black-Scholes model. However, as previously stated, it is often hard to find out the true volatility of a security as well as the underlying distribution of its price at a future date. In addition, exotic options, such as binary, Bermuda, quantity-adjusting, Asian, look-back, basket, extendible, spread, shout, and range options have no well-known closed-form expressions for their fair prices. As a result, machine learning algorithms are often used in conjunction with mathematical models. The derivative pricing team will work with the other teams to explore methods that can be to price various derivatives, as well as to determine a suitable corresponding market that can be made. 

Algorithmic Trading (DS, SWE): Technical indicators such as trend, moving averages, delta, gamma, etc… potentially give insight into the distribution of the future price of a security that is not reflected in the market. There are a variety of methods used by trading firms to gauge future price possibilities and members on the algo trading division will work closely with members of the derivative pricing division to construct potential strategies to exploit market inefficiencies. These models will be tested against historical data as well as current market simulations before being put forward for consideration to be used on DAML’s proprietary funds. In addition, members of the team should try to construct a suitable API for their work which would allow the potential for scalability in the future. 

Education: The knowledge gained in our investigation should be shared with the wider Duke community if appropriate. Members of the education team would work with other teams to create a course in algorithmic trading and quantitative finance that is accessible to other students. The final goal is to establish a house course in Fall 2022 (Applications due Feb 11 2021). The course can have many components, including but not limited to portfolio theory, options theory, statistical and machine learning methods in time-series analysis, etc… 

Competitions: Ideally the skills that are gained by the team in the project can be used in related competitions (typically hosted by quant firms). Examples include the Jane Street Market Prediction competition and the Optiver Realized Volatility Prediction competition. Such competition typically has a prize pool of $100,000 and are good indicators of strong quantitative ability for employers. 

# Target Timeline 

Fall 2021: Investigate the primary mathematical models and machine learning methods used for portfolio optimization and algorithmic trading. If models perform acceptably well on historical data, we will test a preliminary implementation of these models in the real market via mock trading (as is typically done for new strategies in real quant firms). In addition, we will draft the relevant course materials for our potential house course. 

Spring 2022: If possible, application of successful trading models onto DAML’s proprietary funds; if not, we will keep trying to make strategies that actually work on market simulations. Continued development of trading strategies and algorithms in either case. In addition, offer in-person certification courses on the statistical and machine learning methods used in portfolio theory and algorithmic trading. Ideally, we will be able to attract a lot of students which would show high demonstrated interest in quant trading. Apply for house course status. 

Summer 2022: Our automated trading strategies and optimized portfolio will have a few months to demonstrate their ability to deliver returns. We can also network with Duke admin during this period to increase the possibility of funding. 

Fall 2022: If all goes well, DAML will have a quantitative finance division with Duke funding. We will continue recruiting new members to improve our proprietary software and strategies. We will be holding the house course in addition to the course regarding our certification program. If we have not achieved any of our goals then we can continue working on them.
